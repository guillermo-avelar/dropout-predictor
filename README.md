# Predicting School Dropouts in El Salvador ðŸŽ’

<b>Author:</b> Guillermo Avelar  
<b>Description: </b> ML model allowing Salvadoran policy makers to predict school dropouts.<br/>
<b>Last updated:</b> July 31st 2024<br/>
<b>Status:</b> Work in Progress

## Context â„¹
This project is a revision of an earlier version I worked during high school. My earlier version implemented simple regression techniques, and so I wanted to take it to a new level.

## Problem ðŸ‘Ž

Salvadorean students are leaving schools. Policy makers need data-driven models to predict how their policies impact school dropout rates.

## Solution ðŸ”¥

Create a machine learning model to predict school dropouts based on a variety of school factors.

## Project Organization ðŸ§±
